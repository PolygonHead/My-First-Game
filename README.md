# My-First-Game
This is the actual definition of Yandere code. This is the first script I ever made, it was made as soon as I learned what an if statement was.

After this, I didn't learn any new coding for a year. This was sadly made in 2018, not as far back as I'd hope.

Problems:
* I thought when assigning a variable to an input, you had to have an underscore; since everything was snaked cased in the powerpoint presentation.
* Lack of functions
* The sheep ton of if statements
* The "comedy".
* The fact that you have to type of every single thing that you want to do, and you die if you don't lowercase everything (use .lower() past me).
* The fact that it's not finished.
* and 10,000,000 more issues.

Made with someone else who may or may not want to be named.
